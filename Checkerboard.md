1. Reflect on (think about) the work you did for the challenge. How did you do? What did you get right? What did you get wrong? What did you do differently (and possibly better) than what was posted in the solution? What was hard to do?
* When assigning the dimension variables, I parsed the text of the menu and got the number where as the solution used switch cases to match them. In the long run, my solution would be able take in any dimensional size defined in the MenuItem where as the class solution would have to manually add switch case for each additional dimension. 

2. How well did you understand the programming concepts and foundational knowledge needed to complete the challenge?


3. How well did you meet the requirements as set out in the challenge? What requirements did you not meet correctly (if any)?

4. How well does your solution match the posted solution? What is different?

5. How could you improve going forward? What don't you still understand that was required for the challenge?
